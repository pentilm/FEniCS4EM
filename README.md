Alright, with those details, I will modify the README.md file accordingly:

# FEniCS for Electromagnetic Field Simulation

This repository contains partial codes used in my computational electromagnetics papers. All codes utilize the FEniCS library, and simulations are performed via finite element methods, particularly using Nedelec elements.

## Code Overview

1. `cloak.py`: Electromagnetic (EM) cloaking simulation.
2. `cloak_edge_carpet.py`: EM carpet cloaking simulation.
3. `graphene_interface.py`: Graphene Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP) simulation.
4. `meta.py`: Metamaterial backward wave propagation simulation.

## Getting Started

To use these codes, clone the repository and navigate into the cloned directory. The scripts can be run individually with the FEniCS environment.

**Note:** The details of how to use these scripts and the necessary dependencies to run them are explained within each script.
